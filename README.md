# Gender Adversial 🏳️‍⚧ 🏳️‍🌈
A web-app to help transgender people in their transition. It mainly aims to reply in an interaction-free and judgement-free way to the harsh question affecting most transgender people: "Do I pass?". It is thought as a tool which can be used for tasks such as choosing a more passing profile picture for a social media, a hairstyle, or checking how is it going with the voice-training. It is NOT meant as a guide to the transition in any way, and must be used with caution.

TO DO:
- [x] image gender detection model
- [x] image gender detection interface
- [x] audio gender detection model
- [ ] audio gender detection interface*
- [ ] performance optimization and deployment

\* waiting for Streamlit to release a voice-recording component, or for [this](https://github.com/stefanrmmr/streamlit_audio_recorder) repo to implement the functions needed for audio processing...

Maybe in the future:
- [ ] rewrite it with React.js
- [ ] real-time spectrogram for voice-training
